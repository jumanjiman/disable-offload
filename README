Provides: a SysV-style init script and a supporting admin script.
Purpose: disable Ethernet offload settings at boot time, if desired.

Usage:
* install "disable-offload" rpm
* chkconfig disable-offload on
* service disable-offload start

Known issues:
* Does not store initial state of offload settings,
  so "service disable-offload stop" does not re-enable offload
